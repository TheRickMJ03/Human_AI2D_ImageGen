# Human_AI2D_ImageGen

A web-based interface for local AI-powered image generation from text prompts.

## Overview

Human_AI2D_ImageGen is a locally-hosted web application that enables users to generate images from text prompts using AI models. The system consists of:

- React-based frontend interface
- Python Flask backend
- Integration with Hugging Face API (FLUX.1-schnell model)

The application provides a complete workflow for image generation, including prompt input, real-time generation status, image display, and a persistent gallery of previously generated images stored locally.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- Text-to-image conversion using FLUX.1-schnell model
- Real-time generation status updates via WebSocket
- Local storage with timestamp-based file naming
- Error handling and user feedback

### User Interface
- Responsive prompt input
- Live image display with loading animations
- Persistent gallery view
- Modal image viewing
- Smooth CSS animations

### Data Management
- Local file system storage (`generated_images/` directory)
- Metadata preservation in filenames
- Automatic image history loading
- Cross-session persistence
